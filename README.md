# Hedgehog

A 60ish keyboard with a new plate-case design. This has been heavily inspired
by the layout of [Purple Owl](https://github.com/SonalPinto/purple-owl) but I
wanted a more programmer friendly right side with larger modifier keys. So I
changed some keys and also redesigned the PCB to use a more standard
QMK approach. With LED support and some good keycaps, I think it is a great
looking compact keyboard!

The typing is damped by the felt layer but quite stable due to the pretty firm
brass plate. The springs keep the plate in place but allow some flex as designed.
Sound is really good for what I expected, but I added foam on the plate and
without it the brass plate will be pingy with the missing support in the center.

TL;DR 2: Some upcoming improvements listed at the end

## Status

- I will add some feet, no angle is just too flat too type. ETA unknown.
- Plates and weights have arrived, assembly finalized!
- Case assembled, only plate and weight left, ETA see below.
- Case parts have arrived.
- Plated ETA at 15/11, felt layer ETA 15/11, case parts also ordered with no
ETA. Pricing see below.
- PCBs have arrived and tested good.
- Found plate manufacturer, plates and weight will be brass laser cut. Plate
will have engraving. Cost listed below, comparably cheap for low amount of parts
and a strong reduction in cost with more parts expected.
- Sourcing part manufacturers for casing.
- Case design finished.
- Ordered PCBs for Daughterboard and Keyboard.
- PCB design done.

## Layout

The layout is somewhat odd. The aim was to have a good amount of modifiers
and still keep the interesting stagger and a trapezoidal shape. This lead to the
removal of the nav cluster, thus this is the initial lite version. I might create
another one with arrow cluster and going for a parallelogram shape. Final
layout ended up like this

## Assembly

Final assembly is described here in good detail with the parts I ordered for
the first batch, if you make your own parts some steps might need adaption. Any
question, just let me know!

With all parts produced, the case assembly comes first. See below for how I
proceeded given the parts I had with just laser cutting. Bolts are M3 x 12.
Keep in mind to install the daughterboard in between the case rings or just use
two screws. Weight needs shorter bolts, M3 x 5 work or just cut down some
longer ones.

I then added switch pads and plate foam to PCB and plate, since brass plates
often tend to be a little pingy. I chose some generic KBDfans stabilizers which
was a bad choice since they rattle. Next re-assembly, I'll change to some better
ones.

Finally, assemble plate and PCB with switches (Tangerines linear):
![(Final assembly)](assets/pcb-and-plate-final.jpg)

Place felt on case and align, place plate with PCB, and screw down with a soft
washer, spring (see below in parts table) and bolt using the same M3 x 12. Done!
Just add some keycaps, I chose PBTfans Resonance. Base Kit and 40s are a good
fit, sometimes base kit is enough, just need the split spacebars.

#### Plate and Case

##### Plate

Plates and weights were laser cut but the first batch has issues with
tolerances and surface quality. The engraving, especially, is barely visible.
I tried to glassbead blast two samples which increased surface feel quality
and produced usable samples. The engraving however vanishes. I have the leftover
plates if someone wants them but keep those issued in mind.

![(Final plate)](assets/more-final-parts.jpg)

Same for the weights - but they are invisible. So for those I just cut the
two threads and sanded them down a bit.

![(Weight assembly)](assets/weight-fab.jpg)


##### Case

Case acrylic parts have been produced. Cut quality is acceptable. This prototype is
built with four layers just 2D cut, so some steps remain in creating the case:
First, countersink the screw holes in the bottom (also, from the bottom side).
I have a drill press, if by hand try to keep it as symmetric as possible. I then
went on to cut the M3 threads for the six bolts for case assembly, which are
only cut in the uppermost acrylic part. Pre-assemble two (in my case blue) top
rings and cut five threads, M3, for plate from top. With only two rings you can
cut the threads in an open hole and don't need to worry about the blind holes.
Finally, assemble the four acrylic parts (bottom, frosted ring, blue ring, top
blue ring). Place felt layer (in my case orange) on top. Some impressions:

#### PCB

PCBs have arrived and look quite cool. All features seem to work! Tested both FWs
and all buttons, LEDs and other features work as expected.
**TL;DR** *No need to solder any headers and ISP, out of the box PCBs accept
initial firmware using `qmk flash` over USB!* Thanks, ATMEL (I guess, but please
update your documentation!).

More informations? Keep on reading...

![(Hedgehog Lite PCB 1)](assets/pcb-fab-front.jpg)
![(Hedgehog Lite PCB 2)](assets/pcb-fab-detail.jpg)
![(Hedgehog Lite PCB 3)](assets/pcb-fab-back.jpg)

First thing I noticed is that I chose a 1.27mm spacing for ISP which I did not
have around, so I had to fetch some
headers. Soldering is quite annoying at that pitch but doable. Next up was an
adapter for my ISP programmer which again was for 2.54mm spacing. Again very
fiddly. Should've tested before to avoid some burnt fingers.
Finally, solder RST switch at the front, thats quite easy.

For an initial check if everything is hooked up run
```
> avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4

seems good, check the fuses:

Perfect, nothing to change here. Mind that `JTAG` is on but that should not be
of an issue here. Go ahead and flash the firmware (just use production, which
includes a bootloader!)

```

Perfect, you can test the PCB now and / or test the bootloader by flashing a
new firmware using QMK (after copying the folders or running from the repo)
```
qmk flash -kb 11kbd/hedgehog_lite -km default
```
All works! If you want to prevent changing the FW, just open the slide switch
and any reprogramming will be disabled.

#### Daughterboard

Daughterboards just work out of the box - nothing to add here. Building the
cables, however, is an issue. First, I tried to crimp them myself but even with the
smaller pliers I did not manage to have a good reproducible result. I then just
bought single sided cables and soldered the wires using two ends. Not pretty
but works, and if you look at some shop offers online, it does look to be an
often used workaround.

I did find a custom cable shop in CN which can produce the cables for around
0,40â‚¬ per cable but they start at 100pcs so this wasn't a good option here.
Maybe if some group buy will run at some point, I will follow this route. For
now, !no cables are available from my side!

## PCB Details

The PCB is a basic QMK capable **ATmega32U4** row-col setup, using 9 rows and
9 columns. The PCB was designed in KiCAD and the current design is somewhere
between WiP and ready for a prototype. Cool features include a good number of
underglow (15) LEDs and some flex cuts. Switch sockets are hotswap and layout
is a single fixed one, derived from ANSI. No stepped caps or any splits at this point.

The USB connection is a JST with support for *Unified Daughterboard* by **ai03**
which make the PCB able to move and flex and saves some space. Also, feel free
to adapt the case to place the USB wherever you want.

![(Hedgehog Lite PCB Top)](assets/hedgehog-lite-pcb-top.png)
![(Hedgehog Lite PCB Bot)](assets/hedgehog-lite-pcb-bot.png)

There are, compared to other PCBs out there, some smaller quirks and features
which are notable:
- The PCB uses a *M*-variant of the AtMega due to shortages and prices hikes of
the more common *A*-variant. Also, this one is a little more compact.
- The implemented *M*-variant has **no USB bootloader** flashed. Initially,
this has to be done (or not see above). Using a basic *ISP* programmer,
check the fuses and if needed set them to the QMK values (which are good for
external oscillator). Afterwards, USB flashing using *RST* over USB *should*
work (confirm that *HWB* switch is closed!). See assembly section for details!
- LED power supply is activated with a solder jumper. This reduces current
during initial flash and allows to leave LEDs disabled in non-translucent cases.
- HWB pin is connected with a switch. So by either not soldering this in or
setting to open position bootloader access and flashing can be preventing and
also reducing startup time / room for errors. A jumper exists to fully override
the switch.
- Reset switch is placed on bottom ("top" during use) layer below spacebar so
resetting can be done with case fully assembled.

The above should make it clear that **even with an assembled PCB** minimal
soldering is required for full functionality. I will only have one PCB side
assembled to save money - so when **using this procedure or leftover PCBs**.
I might offer the reset switch has to be placed and soldered afterwards to allow
bootloader flash.

## Case and Mount Details

Case will be designed for either laser cutting or printing / milling. Currently,
the case is layered for cutting so some cutouts aren't perfect but milling is
not feasible in prototyping and small batch. Current color design is frosted
bottom, blue mid, warm yellow felt and brass plate. Overall height will be 16.5mm
to plate surface. Feets are optional and might get added to tent the whole case.

Bottom and three rings (one acrylic, two blue, split not visible in render)
will be screwed from below. Plate will be screwed from top into preassembled
bottom.

Plate is designed to be aluminum or brass, and the plate mount is done via a
felt / cork dampening layer and springs. Plate logo is optional depending on
engraving capabilities of specific shops.

Initial CAD renders below showing top, spring mount in comparison with
switch size and the connector which is currently placed at the left side.

## Name
Because its autumn and that's the perfect time for them!

## Cost breakdown

Obviously, this is a prototype / small batch so pricing will a) comparable high
and b) differ in different locations. Also, due to my profession, I do have some
connection which make some of the steps easier. Cost is listed for an order
of (at least) five keyboards. Second to last column shows parts which are surplus
(contact me if you are interested!)

## ToDos for a V1.1

- Improve GND on PCB for controller. Not needed since it works really good but
better practice
- Improve plate manufacture or / and increase switch opening size. The current
dimensioning is ok but fairly tight.
- Do the same for the stabs, if possible add at least 1mm left / right for the
stems
- Find a way to keep the felt layer aligned, currently it tends to slide around
a bit - purely a visual error but still needs improving.
- Add some more layout options: Switch BS, Mod key right of return, ISO?
